== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I define a static homepage or blog posts page? =
To now set this as your homepage navigate to Settings > Reading in the dashboard. In the “Front page displays” section check the “static page” option and select the page you just created from the dropdown then save the settings.

That page you created and added the homepage page template to will now be loaded when anyone visits your site's homepage.

If you want to have a page to display your blog posts too, you will have to create another page (you can leave the content blank) and set that as the Posts Page in the same settings section like above where we created a blank page titled Blog on our site and set that as the posts page.
= How do I install theme demo content? =
To install some demo content for products as a starting point you can import the WooCommerce Dummy Data which will populate your site with demo products for you.
Dummy data for WooCommerce located in a file called dummy-data.xml, which can be found inside the WooCommerce plugin directory.

Note: We do not recommend this if you have existing content in your WordPress installation, as it will add numerous posts, pages, categories, media and more to your site. Also, we recommend replacing all content as soon as possible to avoid negative SEO effects or image licensing repercussions.

Note: We do not supply the exact images you see on our Hypermarket demo within the WooCommerce Dummy Data as the pictures of the site cannot be redistributed due to copyright restrictions and are for demo purposes only. The WooCommerce Dummy Data instead comes with our unique unrestricted images that we can redistribute within product import data.
